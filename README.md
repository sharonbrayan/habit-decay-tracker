<h1>HabitHorizon – Habit Tracker with Decay Scoring</h1>

<h3>A MERN-based productivity app to track habits, visualize consistency, and measure decay using smart scoring logic.</h3>

🚀 Overview

HabitHorizon is a full-stack MERN application that helps users build better habits through tracking, consistency analytics, and visual progress charts.
Each habit stores completion timestamps, and the backend calculates a decay score based on how recently and consistently the habit is completed.

The decay score is displayed as a bar graph to give users instant visibility into their habit health.
